### To answer "Why Gatsby?", we need to ask "What is Gatsby?" 

Gatsby is a static site generator. Your website is written with static files, stuch as html, css, and javascript. All the files are already written waiting to be called. Unlike a dynamic website, where the content is generated dynamically based on the user's request. As a result, static websites are usually faster and more secure. Other pros are simple, no webserver needed, no database maintained, and you can use git, which provides version control.

The cons of static websites are no user generated content like a comments section. However, there are work arounds like Disqus, which will be a future addition to this blog. Other cons are limited functionality and need some programming knowlege to interact with the code, especially structural changes or updates.

### What are other alternative static site generators?

In my research, I found other popular options are Jekyll and Hugo. Hugo is written in Golang. My limited understandins is Golang is a speedy language. So if speed is a priority, then this is the natural choice. Jekyll is probably by far the most popular static website generator because it has been around for 10 years and because of it's affiliation with GitHub. Jekyll is written in Ruby.

### My decision to go with Gatsby

I went with Gatsby mainly because of my familiarity with html, css, and javascript, attained through the Data Analytics and Visualization Certification at Washington University St. Louis. I wanted to use what I was already familiar with to build a website as quickly as possible. As an aspiring data scientist, the blogposts authored by me will focus on python, math and statistics, sql, and machine learning.
